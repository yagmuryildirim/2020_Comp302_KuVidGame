# 2020_Comp302_KuVidGame
 
Throughout the Fall 2020 term, we have developed the KUvid Game as the term project of Comp 302. We have implemented this project by following the Model-View Separation, GRASP, and GOF Patterns that we have acquired during the classes. These patterns and Model-View Separation Principle made the game easier-to-update and made it possible to use on many devices as the domain layer is not UI-dependent.
